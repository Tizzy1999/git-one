## Git
---
- It's a system that records changes to our files over time

- We can recall specific versions of those files at any given time

- Many people can easily collaborate on a project and have their own version of project files on their computer

## Repositories
---
- A repo is a container for a project you want to track with Git, such as a website project

- Can have many different repo's for many different projects on your computer

- Like a project folder which git tracks the contents for us


## Commits (Save Points)
---
- Modified: Changed files Not committed

- Staging: Add any changed files to staging that you want to committed

- Any files in the staging areas are added to the commit when we make one
