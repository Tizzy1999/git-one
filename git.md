## Git
---
- It's a system that records changes to our files over time

- We can recall specific versions of those files at any given time

- Many people can easily collaborate on a project and have their own version of project files on their computer

## Repositories
---
- A repo is a container for a project you want to track with Git, such as a website project

- Can have many different repo's for many different projects on your computer

- Like a project folder which git tracks the contents for us


## Git Stages
---
- Modified: Changed files Not committed

- Staging: Add any changed files to staging that you want to committed

- Any files in the staging areas are added to the commit when we make one

#### What's staging for?
- By adding it to staging area, it allows us to review our changes before we make commits

- Commits happen only after cetain points, for example, certain features have been developed, it's not as simple as saving files.

- You only share your work, after you're satisfied.

- Also enable separate different commits for different changes.

## Commits
---
- Save Points

- Basically, a snapshot of your code at particular point

- The green color of file name indicates that the file has been changed, but not yet committed

## Undo commits

- Checkout commit: show history committed code, read-only, not rewrite history

- Revert commit: undo a commit, like it never existed

- Reset commit: permanantly take you back in time at a particular commit

## Branch

- Allow creating different branches without messing up with the master branch

#### How to merge the branches back to the master?

- Go back to the branck you want to merge into

- When merging, we won't make any changes to the master branch
